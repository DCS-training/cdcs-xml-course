<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Formerly prouided this Sermon for you
in a Country Auditory. Your occasi∣ons
then carried you elsewhere.
The approbation it receiued from
such learned Diuines as hapned to
be present, made mee settle my thoughts and medita∣tions
againe vpon it. Those second thoughts and
meditations gaue it a new being, and that growth,
<PB REF="3"/>
that it came from the Country to the City. Mee∣ting
there with the Presse, it presumeth to presse
from the City to the Court, bearing your Honours
name in the forehead. For whither could it bee
sent more fitly to cry downe the reigning of sinne,
than to Court? where vertue and not sinne should
reigne among the Peeres and Nobles of so vertuous
and pious a King as wee haue:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. histor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 4. 3.</NOTE> who like the Emperors

Great, (besides his priuate reading) is a great and
constant hearer of Sermons, the meanes to receiue
sacred instructions to keepe sinne from reigning in his
mortall body. Let mee not be thought then presump∣tuous
if I dedicate this small worke of mine to your
Honours, to be a Remora to stay you from yeelding
to the inchanting allurements of such perdition-wor∣king
Syrens, as are alwayes seducing the fraile na∣ture
of man vnto sinne. Neither doe I this, because
I any wayes deeme your Honours prone to follow
such, or because you want either good precepts or
neere examples to follow.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ux,</HI> his Maiesties Pro∣fessor or Diui∣nitie in the V∣niuersitie of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE> For, my good Lord, besides
your owne gracious disposition, you haue been brought
vp at the feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> in the Vniuersitie, that
hath furnished you with the one: you haue those noble
<PB REF="3"/>
Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earle of <HI>Pembroke</HI> Lord Steward, and the Earle of <HI>Montgomery</HI> Lord Cham∣berlaine to his Maiesties houshold.</NOTE> your Vncle and Father in Law, neere and

direct you in both. And you, right noble Lady, (as
inheritrix of your deceased Lady-mothers vertues)
are ready to ioyne in the practice of such actions as
may bring eternall happinesse to you both. But I de∣dicate
these my poore labours to your Honours to en∣courage
you to goe on in what you are. For your
Lordship well knowes that of the Poet;
<Q><L>Qui monet vt facias, quod jam facis, ipse monendo<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid.</NOTE></L>
<L>Laudat, &amp; hortatu comprobat acta suo.</L></Q></P>
<P>I deuote them to you, as a sure testimonie of my vn∣fained
respect to your Honours, and heartie desire that
you may be saued in the day of the Lord. For seeing
this Sermon (such as it then was) should haue beene
yours before, seeing you haue beene graciously plea∣sed
to receiue mee for yours since, to whom may it
more fitly be appropriated than to your Honours? So
that I may say to each of you with the Poet;
<Q><L>Hoc lege quod possis dicere jure meum est.</L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Censurers I shall haue, and doe expect, many;
but I feare or regard none. My aime is Gods
glory, to cast my mite into the Treasurie of the
<PB REF="4"/>
Church, for the good of my Country in generall, and
to testifie my desire of doing your Honours seruice in
particular. This is the marke I looke at, and I shall
euer endeuour by Gods grace to hit it. The criticall
Spectators I passe by, without any glance on them; I
shall neuer care to please them. That Archer which
lookes on the standers by, and not on the marke, can∣not
but misse his aime; and that Writer which ende∣uours
to please all, shall please none, neither God,
good men, nor himselfe. But if (next to Gods glory
and the Churches good) your Honours, out of your
wonted candor, will be pleased to accept it, I shall
attaine my wished scope, and shall be encouraged
further to shew my selfe,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N <HI>Adams</HI> being we had all our being:
and in his fall wee all receiued a fall.
His person (being the first) infected
our humane nature: our humane na∣ture
(being from him) infects our
persons. So that now no man liuing,
without the brand laid vpon him by
S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> of deceiuing himselfe, and lying to others, can
say he is without sinne:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Ioh. 1. 8.</NOTE> <HI>If we say that we haue no sinne, we

<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
those the sweetest, haue their pricks; Men, and those the
best, haue their faults.) S. <HI>Iames</HI> outstrips S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> and
saith, that we doe not onely offend all, but we offend all
many wayes;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <HI>In many things we offend all, Iam.</HI> 3. 2. The
Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> (though this be alreadie too much, for
our store) augments the store, and makes the many sins,
many many sins, so many, that we know not how many;
<HI>Who can tell how oft he offendeth?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Lord cleanse me from my
secret faults: Psal.</HI> 19. 12. So that then the righteous∣nesse
of man consisteth not in hauing no sinne, for then
no man could bee iustified, no man could be righteous;
but it consisteth in mans stout resisting and suppressing of
sinne, that it reigne not in him, and presumptuously get
the dominion ouer him, and Gods free remission of sin,
that it bee not imputed vnto him, hee condemned for it.
<HI>Dauid</HI> therefore prayes against the dominion of sinne,
that he may be <HI>innocent from the great offence:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. 13.</NOTE> and S. <HI>Paul</HI>
exhorts vs to resist and suppresse sinne and his lusts, that
it reigne not in vs, and wee incurre the irreuocable sen∣tence
of eternall death for our offence. <HI>Let not sin reigne
therefore in your mortall bodie, that yee should obey it in the
lusts thereof.</HI> As if the Apostle had sayd; To exhort you
to an absolute puritie, were to enjoyne you an absolute
impossibilitie. For there was neuer yet any man altoge∣ther
pure, and without sinne <HI>(Christ Iesus</HI> excepted, who
was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, both God and man) but yet a man need
not be all sinne; he need not yeeld the powers and facul∣ties
of his soule, and members of his bodie, as instru∣ments
of vnrighteousnesse vnto sinne, and so let sinne
haue his full careere in him, and rule and reigne in his
mortall bodie, but hee may by the grace of God resist
sinne, and so haue but few, and those but vnderling sins;
and those few vnderling sinnes, by the great and super∣abundant
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
mercie of God in Iesus Christ forgiuen, and
not imputed vnto him. For, as when wee walke abroad
in the fields to take the aire, ye cannot hinder the Fowles
thereof from flying and houering ouer our heads, but
we may well hinder them from roosting, building, and
making their nests there:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪</NOTE> Euen so, as long as wee liue in
this vale of miserie, clad with these weeds of mortalitie,
this bodie of ours, wee cannot chuse but haue sinne ho∣uering
vp and downe in vs, but we may chuse whether
we will let it roost there, wee may chuse whether we will
let it build and make his nest there, to rule and domineere
in our mortall bodie; therefore the Apostle here in my
Text saith, <HI>Let not sinne therefore reigne in your mortall bo∣die,
that you should obey it in the lusts thereof.</HI></P>
<P>In which Text I shall commend three things to your
obseruation.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Here is a King described by his reigning, namely
Sinne; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Let not sinne there∣fore
reigne.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Here are his lawes declared, by obeying,</HI> viz. <HI>his
lusts;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, That you
should obey it in the lusts thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Here is his Kingdome specified by the place where
he would reigne, <HI>viz. your mortall bodie,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>in your mortall bodie.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origen in Epis.</NOTE> <HI>Peccatum velut sedem quandam &amp; solium regni sui
in nostro corpore collocatum habet:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ad Rom lib. 5.</NOTE> saith <HI>Origen.</HI> Sinne hath,
as it were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">cap. 6. tom. 2.</NOTE> the fear and throne of his kingdome in our
mortall bodie.</P>
<P>In all which there is such an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and disorder, that
this Common-wealth cannot stand long.</P>
<P>1. The King he is insulting, it is Sinne, which at first
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
got footing in <HI>Adam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> a little new inspired <HI>slime of
the earth,</HI> and by that wound it selfe into all the
men of the earth.</P>
<P>2. The kingdome that's decaying, it is your perishing
mortall bodie: which as soone as it hath life and
being, tends to dissolution and not being. Like
apples of <HI>Sodom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 48.</NOTE> a touch turnes it into dust and
ashes.</P>
<P>3. Lastly, the lawes they are vnlawfull, they are lusts:
<HI>Quicquid libet licet.</HI> What it lusteth, that it willeth.</P>
<P>Here is <HI>aliud ex alio malum,</HI> Disorder vpon disorder. A
wilfull king, a rufull kingdome, and hatefull lawes. <HI>S. Paul</HI>
therefore, the Embassadour of the King of Kings and
Lord of Lords, teacheth vs in my Text, how to order
this disorder, and how to deale with each of these.</P>
<P>1. Sinne must be suppressed, and kept from reigning:
<HI>Let not sinne reigne therefore.</HI></P>
<P>2. Lusts, the lawes; they must not be obeyed, <HI>obey it
not in the lusts thereof.</HI></P>
<P>3. Your mortall bodie, the kingdome, that must bee
repaired, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uinate decaying mortall bodies, you
must make your selues strong and liuely bodies. For so
it followeth in the verse after my Text. <HI>Neither yeeld your
members as instruments of vnrighte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usnesse vnto sinne, but
yeeld your selues vnto God, as those that are aliue from the
dead, and your members as instruments of righteousnesse
vnto God.</HI> And of these three in their order. And first of
sin, that he must be suppressed. <HI>Let not sinne reigne,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Let not sinne reigne therefore.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Parable of <HI>Iotham</HI> in the ninth of <HI>Iudges,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 9. 25.</NOTE> that of
all the trees the Bramble (that base hedge creeping
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
shrub) would needs take vpon it to be King. So of all that
mans nature is incident vnto, sinne (that base deprauitie
of nature) must needs take vpon him to be king, and to
<HI>reigne in our mortall body.</HI> Nay that will not content him,
to reigne as a king, but he will make hauocke of all like a
tyrant. For Sin is the greatest tyrant that euer the world
had.</P>
<P>Other tyrants (though monstrously raging) killed but
some persons; <HI>Nero</HI> killed his mother that bare him, and
his Master <HI>Seneca</HI> that taught him; he burnt the Citie of
<HI>Rome</HI> that was vnder his soueraignty &amp; obeyed him; but
these are but petty slaughters in respect of those which
sinne makes. For, that spares none; it killed all those that
liued before vs, it will kill all vs that are now liuing, and
all that euer shall be borne after vs. It is good therefore
to keepe our selues free-men, from being slaues to so
hauocke-making a Tyrant. <HI>Let not sinne reigne there∣fore
in your mortall bodie, that you should obey it in the lusts
thereof.</HI></P>
<P>No man would be willing to serue a Master, how great
a Prince soeuer he were, that when his seruant had spent
his youthfull yeares, cripled his sturdie limbs, and wasted
his plentifull estate in his seruice, and comes for his re∣ward,
will draw his sword and kill him (surely none would
be willing to receiue their pay in such crackt coine:) but
sinne dealeth so with vs; when we haue yeelded all the
powers and faculties of our-soules, and the members of
our bodies, to be commanded by sinne, whats the re∣ward
he giues vs but death? so saith the Apostle in the
last verse of this Chapter:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. v. vlt.</NOTE> <HI>The wages of sinne is death, but
the gift of God is eternall life through Iesus Christ our Lord.</HI>
Those then which neglect the seruice of God, and giue
themselues ouer to the tyrannous subiection of sinne, are
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
like the perfidious Iewes, who reiected Christ the giuer
of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 27. 21.</NOTE> and desired <HI>Barabas</HI> a murderer to be giuen them,
<HI>Matth.</HI> 27. 21. Let vs therefore shake off the murthering
yoke of sinne, and by true and heartie repentance send a
messenger of defiance vnto it, saying with those citizens
in the Gospell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 19. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Nolumus hunc regnare super nos; We will not
haue this man, we will not haue sinne reigne ouer vs.</HI> And as
<HI>Origen</HI> exhorts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origen. in Epist. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rom. lib. 5.</NOTE> <HI>vnusquis{que} pessimum regem regnantem in suâ
carne depellat:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">cap. 6. tom. 2.</NOTE> Let euery man expell this euill king reig∣ning
in his flesh. <HI>Let not sinne reigne therefore in your mor∣tall
bodie.</HI></P>
<P>Now Kings, as the Politickes teach vs, doe ordinarily
<LIST>
<ITEM>obtaine their rule two
wayes, either by
<LIST>
<ITEM>Succession, and so are Kings,
as it were, naturally: or</ITEM>
<ITEM>Election, and so are Kings a∣doptiuely.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
but this king sinne, because he would be sure to be king
some way, claimes the rule of our mortal body both these
wayes, both by succession and election. But his title of
succession hath beene found weake long agoe. That in∣deed
shewes his antiquitie, how <HI>Lucifer</HI> begot him when
he was cast out of heauen. That indeed shewes that hee
hath free-hold of inheritance in our mortall body; but
truly no Lord to command it, or King to rule it. Elect
him not therefore for your King, so you shall preuent
him of his kingdome; so you shall keepe him from reig∣ning
in your mortall body. <HI>Let not sinne reigne therefore
in your mortall body.</HI></P>
<P>And that you may not elect him, you must know that
as there are three things concurring to the election of a
politicall King;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Nomination.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Consultation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Consent or Approbation.</ITEM>

three steps.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregor. Mag. Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Curae par. 3. admon. 30. tom. 1.</NOTE> For as <HI>S. Gregery</HI> obserues, there are three de∣grees

<ITEM>1 Suggestion, offered by the Deuill.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Delight, administred by the flesh.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Consent, yeelded by our reason.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The first, that is, Suggestion, is like to Nomination.</P>

<P>Suggestion begins sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Delight continues, Consent

shall preuent him of his kingdome, and keepe him from
reigning in your mortall body. <HI>Let not sinne therefore

For the bread the Deuill presents thee, is truely no
bread to feed thee, but a stone to smite thee; the fish hee
shewes, is truly no fish to nourish thee, but a serpent to

and God goes on to punish their sinnes, sinne followes
sinne, and one death followes another. The second
death followes the first: the death of the bodie begins,
and the death of both bodie and soule followes after.
The death of the bodie is, <HI>cum anima deserit corpus,</HI> when

Those that are partners in the fault, must also bee part∣ners

<P>For as a ruinous house (though the wals bee fallen

So this mortall bodie of ours, though it be ruinous, and
the fleshy walls falling downe, and the thatch of the

<P>ANd here by our mortall bodie, we must not vnder∣stand
onely our lumpe of flesh, part of man, but <HI>to∣tum
composuum,</HI> the whole man, consisting of both bodie
and soule. For by a Synecdoche, the part is put for the
whole. The whole man, both bodie and soule, haue sinne
in them, working their ruine and destruction, therefore
the whole man, both bodie and soule, are to be repaired,
and we are to labour for their restauration.</P>
<P>I know there is a great dispute betwixt the bodie and
soule, each endeuouring to put off the enormitie of sin∣ning
to the other. The bodie pleads for it selfe; that that
is but <HI>inanimis truncus.</HI> a dead and senslesse trunke, voyd
of all action and motion, and so could not sinne, nor ex∣ercise
any operation, if the soule did not actuate and en∣force
it. The soule, that pleads for it selfe, that that is <HI>pu∣rus
&amp; simplex spiritus,</HI> a pure and simple spirit, voyd of all
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
organs, without eyes to behold vanitie, without hands
to commit folly, without feet to follow enormitie, and if
the bodie did not detaine it as prisoner, it would mount
aloft, to take vp its residence in the place of spirits, and
therefore the fault of sinning must needs rest on the bo∣die.
But the verie truth is, that neither the bodie sinnes
without the soule, nor the soule without the bodie, but
like <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Leui,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 49. 5.</NOTE> they are brothers and partners in
mischiefe, and so tend both to eternall destruction, vn∣lesse
we wisely endeuour their timely reparation.</P>
<P><HI>Peter Martyr</HI> in his Commentarie on the fourth booke
of the <HI>Kings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pet. Mart. in 4 Reg c. 4. pag. 215</NOTE> illustrates this by a prettie Simile. There
was (saith he) a master of a family, that committed the
custodie of his Orchard to two seruants, one of them
lame of his feet, and the other blinde. The lame seruant
being taken with the beautie of the apples, told his blinde
fellow-seruant, that if he enioyed the vse of his limbes,
and could goe as well as he, it should not be long but he
would be possessed of some of those apples. The blinde
seruant said, he was as desirous of them as himselfe, and
if he could but see as well as he, they should not rest long
vpon the tree. In the end they agreed to ioyne together:
the whole-limb'd blinde man tooke the well-sighted lame
man on his shoulders, and so hee reached the apples.
Their master comming, and missing his fruit, expostula∣ted
the matter with them. Each framed his excuse. The
blinde man said, he could not haue them, for hee could
not see so much as the tree they grew on. The lame man
said, he need not be suspected; for it was well knowne
he could not climbe, or stand to reach them. But their
master perceiuing their craft, how they had both ioyned
together, put them as they were, one vpon the shoulders
of the other, and punished them both together. So in
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>
verie deed, neither the bodie sinnes without the soule, nor
the soule without the bodie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros. de fide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. c. 5.</NOTE> but <HI>corporis animique commu∣nis
est actus,</HI> saith <HI>S. Ambrose,</HI> It is the common act of
both: therefore both bodie and soule tend to death, and
if they be not repaired, will fall to vtter ruine and destru∣ction.
Wherefore as sinne the tyrant must not reigne,
nor lusts, the lawes, be obeyed: So our mortall bodie,
his kingdome, must not runne to vtter ruine, but be re∣paired;
<HI>corruption must put on incorruption, and mortalitie

<P>Watching, that's good for both bodie and soule. By

<P>3. There remaines yet the third and last watch, that
is, the watch of our hands ouer our workes; wee must
watch ouer our workes, that we neither omit that which
we should doe; nor commit that which we ought not to

and strictest watch. For there redounds greater disho∣nour
to God, and more ill examples to men, by the euill
acts of our hands, than by the thoughts of our hearts, or
the words of our mouths. If it please you therefore to
cast the eye of your vnderstanding vpon the Decalogue,
vpon the ten Commandements, you shall finde more
Commandements forbidding sinne in action, than in
the speech, or cogitation. Looke into the first Table;
there is one commandement forbidding sinne in the
heart, namely, the first, <HI>Thou shalt haue no other gods but me.</HI>
There's another forbidding sin in the tongue, namely the

sinne in the heart, namely the tenth, <HI>Thou shalt
not couet,</HI> &amp;c. There's another forbidding sinne in the
tongue, namely the ninth, <HI>Thou shalt not beare false wit∣nesse
against thy neighbour.</HI> But the other foure forbid sin
in action. And hereby we are taught, that if we will keepe

sinne from reigning in our mortall bothe, we must watch
ouer our hands, to keepe them from acting and commit∣ting
sinne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 56. 2.</NOTE> For, saith the Prophet <HI>Esay, Blessed us the man

must therefore, to suppresse sinne, and to keepe it from
reigning in our mortall body, not only abstain from meat
and drinke, but from all vice and impiety; and exercise
our selues in acts of deuotion, spend our time in prayer
and meditation, releeue the needy, and performe workes

To our watching then we must ioyne fasting, and to
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>
our fasting we must ioyne deuout prayer and holy medi∣tation,
and this is the third and the last helpe to repaire
our mortall body, and to keepe sinne from reigning in it.</P>
<P>Let not sinne therefore reigne in your mortall body, that you
should obey it in the lust thereof.</P>
<P>The first helpe, that is, watching, is the besieging of
sinne; the second, fasting, is the disarming of sinne; but
this last helpe, praying, is the vtter vanquishing and sup∣pressing
of sinne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 17. 9.</NOTE> For as <HI>Moses</HI> lifting vp his hands, <HI>Israel</HI>
preuailed against their enemies, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17. 9. So let vs lift
vp our hearts and hands to God, in humble and heartie
prayer, and wee shall preuaile against sinne, and keepe it
from reigning in our mortall bodie. The deadly serpent
the B. siliske (as <HI>Isiodorus, Hispalensis</HI> reporteth) is killed by

driue it out when he hath found it, by weeping and fa∣sting.

doing, though wee cannot altogether acquit and cleare
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>
our selues of sinne, yet we shall haue but few sinnes, and
those few sinnes shall be remissible and pardonable sinnes
vnto vs. Not for that they doe merit remission, or are so
small that they are vnworthy Gods punishment; but be∣cause
remission doth follow such sinnes, neither shall
they be imputed to vs to our condemnation. Herein we
shall be happie, that our sinnes shall not be imputed vn∣to
vs. For they are not blessed, which haue no sinne; for
then no man could be blessed (we are all miserable wret∣ched
sinners:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32. 1, 2</NOTE>) but saith the Prophet <HI>Dauid, Blessed is he
whose vnrighteousnesse i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forgiuen, and whose sinne is coue∣red.
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no sinne,
Psal.</HI> 32. 1, 2.</P>
<P>So that all men being sinner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, here is the difference
betwixt the sinnes of the wicked and the sinnes of the
godly. The sinnes of the wicked are committed with an
high hand, they meditate on them in their beds, they
commit them with all greedinesse, they draw sinne with
cart-ropes, they sinne without repentance; therefore
their sinnes are <HI>peccata regnantia,</HI> sinnes reigning in their
mortall bodie, and neuer forgiuen them, but death and
hell reignes ouer them; they die the second death, the
eternall death, the death both of bodie and soule. But
the sinnes of the godly are committed without medita∣tion,
through infirmitie, they are committed with a relu∣ctancie,
there's a combat betwixt the flesh and the Spi∣rit,
they are resisted by watching, they are suppressed and
kept vnder by fasting, they are cast out by praying, they
are repented of with repent mee neuer to be repented of;
therefore their sinnes are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sinnes no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
reigning in their mortall bodie, but by the great mercie
of God, in Christ Iesus, forgiuen and not imputed vnto
them, so that death hath not full power of them, they
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>
die the death of the bodie onely, the first, not the second
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 14. 13.</NOTE> and so die in the Lord, and die blessedly. <HI>For bles∣sed
are they which die in the Lord, euen so saith the Spirit,
they rest from their labours, and their good works follow them,
Reu.</HI> 14. 13.</P>
<P>In one word then to conclude all, with a true and
liuely faith in Christ Iesus, resist sinne, let it not <HI>reigne in
your mortall bodie;</HI> and then you haue done all which is
required to your saluation: then you shall liue happily,
die blessedly, be rewarded plentifully, and possesse Hea∣uen
euerlastingly. Which God of his infinite mercie
grant vnto euerie one of vs. To which God the Father,
the Creator of all, and hater of sinne; God the Sonne,
the Sauiour of all, and Redeemer from the punishment
of sinne; God the Holy Ghost, the Sanctifier of all, and
Purifier from the prauitie of sinne, three Persons, one
only wise God, bee ascribed of vs all, all honour,
glorie, power, dominion, might, and
maiestie, now and for euer∣more.
