# 'Data is Mutable' - An Introduction to XML

Welcome to the repository to the Introduction to XML. This course will be delivered in 2024 and is
intended to provide a basic introduction to designing, creating and utilising XML documents and data.

The course will cover the following areas over two hours:
 - An overview of the development of XML. Its history and uses.
 - XML encoding, data types and data structures.
 - XML validation and controlled vocabularies.
 - A Brief Introduction to XPath.
 - Practical XPath useage and XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language).
 - A summary of other XML technologies (XQuery, XProc).

The materials in this repo were developed by Ed Mackenzie using Jupyter Lab. It utilises the Saxon parse via the saxonche Python library.
