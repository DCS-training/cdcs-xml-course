# cdcs-xml-course
Course notes for the xml course

# Requirements

The course notes herein can be used in Jupyter lab, Jupyter notebook, Google Colab or Noteable.

- U

To install the course use

`!git clone https://github.com/DCS-training/cdcs-xml-course.git`

Check that you have access to the course contents and notes by navigating to the *cdcs-xml-course* folder.

Start the course by the xml-preliminaries.ipnyb, this will check whether the Saxon API can be installed via pip and that the API functions are accessible.

# Notes

You can clean the outputs from the course (on Juypter) by using

`jupyter nbconvert --clear-output *.ipynb`

Check that the pathing is correctly setup. Pathing on lab tends focus around the execution path, so assets will be local to the .ipnyb file (i.e. './'). On colab it will be in the gdrive (i.e. ./cdcs-xml-course).

I'm looking into fixing the pathing so it's more or less contiguous between the various notebook flavours.
