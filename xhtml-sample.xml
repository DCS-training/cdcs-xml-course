                This is an example of using a controlled vocabulary to create a datafile of a particular&nbsp;<b>

                In this case the schema used is the version 1.1 xHTML schema which is broadly analagous to HTML 4.0. 
                There are some notable differences between xHTML and HTML. 
                And although HTML (a form of SGML) is still by far more widespread, xHTML
                is still used quite widely. The <b>EPUB standard</b>, for example, is a modified form of xHTML.

                There are plans at the W3C to align xHTML with HTML5 (xHTML 2.0).
