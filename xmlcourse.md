# The What, Why and Where of XML

## What is XML (eXtensible Markup Language)?

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a digital standard for describing structured and partially structured data. The XML data model and other features are extensively described in the W3C published standards documents:

## XML specification and standards documents
1. __[XML Standards (Fifth Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/)__
2. __[XPath Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/)__ 
3. __[XSL Transformations (XSLT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/)__
4. __[XQuery and XPath Data Models](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel-31/)__
5. __[XML Schema Definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/)__

XML was approved and published as a standard by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1998. The standard itself is a derivative of "Standard Generalised Markup Language" (__[SGML](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/SGML.html)__). Thus it is quite similar in many characteristics to another SGML derivative, __[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)__.

SGML itself is a derivation of __[GML - "Generalized Markup Language"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Language)__ and __[BNF - "Backus-Naur Form"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)__.

## Why is XML?

There are numerous reasons for using XML.

1. Can be used to store arbitary data.
2. Typically intended to be in a form that is human and machine readable.
3. Simple structured open format for long-term sustainability.
4. Mature, established and stable. BNF/GML was in use in the late 1950's.
5. It can express data as a tree, mitigating the need for the complex interactions required for platforms such as relational databases.
